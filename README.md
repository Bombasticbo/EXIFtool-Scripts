# EXIFtool-Scripts
Scripts I use to automatically modify EXIF data tags of jpgs.

Different scripts write...
## date from filename to EXIF datetime
Why?
Because WhatsApp and Signal remove all EXIF Data of a photo. Only the date (+time in Signal) of reception is written to the filename and filedate.
## filedate to EXIF datetime
Why?
Because the filedate is changed when copying a backup of the WhatsApp folder back to the internal storage.

## filename to title fields
Why?
Because Picasa displays under an image not the filename, but the IPTC caption.

## HowTo:
Use in Windows. (For Linux swap ' and " in the exiftool command. And the rest of the batch file, of course.)

A: Drag a file or directory and drop it on the respective script in the Explorer (not in Total Commander).

Or

B: call from commandline as

    [scriptname] [filename].jpg

As in

    FileDate2EXIF.cmd "IMG-20200924-WA0002 Meaningful manually assigned title.jpg"

The Whatsapp filename may be appended by an additional string. If it contains spaces, add quotation marks around it.
