# EXIFtool-Scripts
Scripts I use to automatically modify EXIF data tags of jpgs
## date from filename to EXIF datetime
Because: WhatsApp and Signal remove all EXIF Data of a photo. Only the date (+time in Signal) of reception is written to the filename and filedate.
## filedate to EXIF datetime
Because: the filedate is changed when copying a backup of the WhatsApp folder back to the internal storage.

## write filename to title fields
Because Picasa displays under an image not the filename, but the IPTC caption.
